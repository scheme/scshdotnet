Scsh.net Website
==============

The scsh website is generated using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. Oh the irony!

You'll need to install it to run the site locally.

<code>gem install middleman</code>

then:

<code>cd scshdotnet</code>

then:

<code>bundle exec middleman server</code>

Then you can navigate to http://localhost:4567 and see the site.
